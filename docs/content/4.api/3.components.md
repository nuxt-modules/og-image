## Removed in v6

The `<OgImage>` and `<OgImageScreenshot>` components have been removed. Use the composable equivalents instead:

- [`defineOgImage()`](/docs/og-image/api/define-og-image) — replaces `<OgImage>`
- [`defineOgImageScreenshot()`](/docs/og-image/api/define-og-image-screenshot) — replaces `<OgImageScreenshot>`

See the [v6 migration guide](/docs/og-image/migration-guide/v6) for details.
