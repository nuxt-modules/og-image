title: v5 to v6
description: Migrate Nuxt OG Image v5 to Nuxt OG Image v6.
---

## Nuxt Content v2 Support Removed

Nuxt Content v2 is no longer supported. If you're using `@nuxt/content`, you must upgrade to v3 or later.

The automatic `ogImage` frontmatter handling for Content v2 has been removed. Use `defineOgImage()` in your page components instead.

```ts
// pages/[...slug].vue
defineOgImage({
  component: 'NuxtSeo',
  // ...
})
```

## Config Changes

### `strictNuxtContentPaths` Removed

This option was deprecated and has no effect in Nuxt Content v3. Remove it from your config:

```diff
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ogImage: {
-   strictNuxtContentPaths: true,
  }
})
```

### Chromium `node` Binding Removed

The deprecated `chromium: 'node'` compatibility option has been removed. Use `'playwright'` instead:

```diff
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ogImage: {
    compatibility: {
      runtime: {
-       chromium: 'node',
+       chromium: 'playwright',
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Import Path Changes

### `#nuxt-og-image-utils` Alias Removed

If you were importing from this legacy alias, update your imports:

```diff
- import { ... } from '#nuxt-og-image-utils'
+ import { ... } from '#og-image/shared'
```

### `useOgImageRuntimeConfig` Import Path

The deprecated stub export from `#og-image/shared` has been removed. Import from the correct path:

```diff
- import { useOgImageRuntimeConfig } from '#og-image/shared'
+ import { useOgImageRuntimeConfig } from '#og-image/app/utils'
```

## URL Path Changes

OG Image URLs have been shortened for cleaner output:

| v5 | v6 |
|----|----|
| `/__og-image__/image/` | `/_og/d/` |
| `/__og-image__/static/` | `/_og/s/` |
| `/__og-image__/font/` | `/_og/f/` |
| `/__og-image__/debug.json` | `/_og/debug.json` |

If you have any hardcoded references to the old paths, update them:

```diff
- /__og-image__/image/about/og.png
+ /_og/d/about/og.png
```

## Behavior Changes

### Sharp JPEG Errors

Previously, if Sharp failed to load for JPEG rendering, it would log an error and fall back to PNG silently. Now it throws an error.

Ensure Sharp is properly installed and your runtime supports it if you're using JPEG output. See the [compatibility guide](/og-image/guides/compatibility) for details.
