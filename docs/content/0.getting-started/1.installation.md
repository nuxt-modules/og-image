## Setup Module

Want to know why you might need this module? Check out the [introduction](/docs/og-image/getting-started/introduction).

To get started with Nuxt OG Image, you need to install the dependency and add it to your Nuxt config.

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install nuxt-og-image
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add nuxt-og-image
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add nuxt-og-image
```

```bash [bun]
bun add nuxt-og-image
```

::

Then add the module to your `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['nuxt-og-image']
})
```

## Verifying Installation

Out-of-the-box the module will not do anything until you configure it.

You can verify the module is installed correctly by checking the [Nuxt DevTools](https://devtools.nuxt.com/) for the OG Image tab.

The DevTools is the starting point, providing a playground to design and test your OG Image with full HMR support.

## Configuration

OG Images must be served with absolute URLs. If you're prerendering, you need to provide a Site URL and name.

Add the following to your `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['nuxt-og-image'],
  site: {
    url: 'https://example.com',
    name: 'My Awesome Website'
  }
})
```

The `site` configuration is provided by [Nuxt Site Config](/site-config/guides/setting-site-config), which is automatically installed with this module.

## Next Steps

You've successfully installed Nuxt OG Image, but you need to make your first OG Image.

Follow the [Getting Familiar with Nuxt OG Image](/docs/og-image/getting-started/getting-familar-with-nuxt-og-image) tutorial to get started.
