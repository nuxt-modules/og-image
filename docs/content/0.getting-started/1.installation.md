## Setup Module

Want to know why you might need this module? Check out the [introduction](/docs/og-image/getting-started/introduction).

To get started with Nuxt OG Image, you need to install the dependency and add it to your Nuxt config.

:ModuleInstall{name="og-image" included-in="@nuxtjs/seo"}

## Verifying Installation

Out-of-the-box the module will not do anything until you configure it.

You can verify the module is installed correctly by checking the [Nuxt DevTools](https://devtools.nuxt.com/) for the OG Image tab.

The DevTools is the starting point, providing a playground to design and test your OG Image with full HMR support.

## Configuration

OG Images must be served with absolute URLs, if you're prerendering, you will need
to provide a Site URL.

:SiteConfigQuickSetup

## Choosing a Renderer

Nuxt OG Image supports three rendering engines. The default (Satori) works for most cases.

| Renderer | Speed | CSS Support | Edge Runtime | Best For |
|----------|-------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| [Satori](/docs/og-image/renderers/satori) | Fast | Partial | ✅ | Default, most templates |
| [Takumi](/docs/og-image/renderers/takumi) | Fastest | Limited | ✅ | High-throughput, simple templates |
| [Chromium](/docs/og-image/renderers/chromium) | Slow | Full | ❌ | Complex designs, prerender only |

See the [Renderers](/docs/og-image/renderers) section for detailed comparison and setup.
