## Why use Nuxt OG Image?

When you share a link of your site on social media or some chat platforms, the link will be [unfurled](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-unfurling-but-were-afraid-to-ask-or-how-to-make-your-e64b4bb9254),
displaying a title, description, and an image. All of these are powered by the [Open Graph Prtocol](https://ogp.me/).

Nuxt OG Image allows you to generate these images at runtime or when prerendering, using simple Vue templates.

For example, the OG image for the current page is:

<img src="/__og-image__/static/docs/og-image/getting-started/introduction/og.png">

While it may not help with your organic traffic, it can significantly improve the click-through rate of your pages when shared.

While it's simple to create your own OG images, it can be time-consuming to keep them up-to-date with your site's content and easy to misconfigure
the meta tags for each platform.
