## Why use Nuxt OG Image?

Nuxt OG Image generates social media preview images (og:image) using Vue templates. Images are rendered at build time or on-demand using [Satori](/docs/og-image/renderers/satori), [Takumi](/docs/og-image/renderers/takumi), or [Chromium](/docs/og-image/renderers/chromium).

When you share a link of your site on social media or some chat platforms, the link will be [unfurled](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-unfurling-but-were-afraid-to-ask-or-how-to-make-your-e64b4bb9254),
displaying a title, description, and an image. All of these are powered by the [Open Graph Protocol](https://ogp.me/).

New to Open Graph? Check out the [Mastering Open Graph Tags](/learn/mastering-meta/open-graph) guide to learn more.

For example, check the `og:image` meta tag in the page source to see the OG image for the current page.

While it may not help with your organic traffic, it can significantly improve the click-through rate of your pages when shared.

While it's simple to create your own OG images, it can be time-consuming to keep them up-to-date with your site's content and easy to misconfigure
the meta tags for each platform.
