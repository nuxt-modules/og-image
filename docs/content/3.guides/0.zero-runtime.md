title: Zero Runtime
description: Create OG Images without the server runtime overhead.
---

There are cases where want to deploy our Nuxt app as a server-side app and we want OG Images, but we don't want to host live runtime OG images due to the performance cost of doing so.

This performance cost can add for edge rendering, for a comparison of the [benchmarks](#benchmarks) below.

For this, we introduce the `zeroRuntime` config which will ensure all tree-shakable OG image code is removed for the final output.

## Usage

To enable zero runtime, add the following to your config:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default {
  ogImage: {
    zeroRuntime: true
  }
}
```

## Limitations

When using the Zero Runtime mode none of the community templates will be available in your final build, you must copy+paste any community template that you wish to use into your `components/OgImage` folder.

## Benchmarks

**Nuxt OG Image - Defaults**

Nitro: 1.6mb
- node_modules: 25mb

**Nuxt OG Image - Zero Runtime**

Nitro: 306kb (81% reduction)
- node_modules: 2.0mb (92% reduction)
