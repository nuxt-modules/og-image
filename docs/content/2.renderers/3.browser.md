description: Learn how, when and why to use the Browser renderer.
---

The Browser renderer uses a real browser to take screenshots, giving you full CSS support.

Using Browser is only recommended when you are prerendering all of your images.

## Installation

::code-group

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm i -D playwright-core
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add -D playwright-core
```

```bash [npm]
npm install -D playwright-core
```

::

::note
In development and CI/prerender environments, the browser will auto-install if needed.
::

## Usage

The renderer is determined by the component filename suffix. Create your component with a `.browser.vue` suffix:

```bash
components/OgImage/MyTemplate.browser.vue
```

The module automatically detects the renderer from the filename — no configuration needed.

## Pros

- Full CSS support - any design you can build
- Render JPEGs without using `sharp`
- Page screenshots are simple and saves time

## Cons

- Requires a browser binary to be installed
- Much slower than Satori/Takumi, using it at runtime is not recommended
- Doesn't work on most hosting providers

## Development Browser

When running in a development environment, a local Chrome / Chromium binary will be used, if available.

If it's not, then the Browser renderer will be disabled.

## Prerenderer / CI Browser

When prerendering your images in a CI environment, the module will automatically install a browser binary for you.

If you'd like to opt-out of this, you should disable the binding.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ogImage: {
    compatibility: {
      prerender: {
        browser: false
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Runtime Browser

Browser will only be enabled by default in runtime environments if you have explicitly included the `playwright-core`
dependency in your project and the target environment is compatible.

Check the [compatibility](/docs/og-image/guides/compatibility) guide for more information.

## Cloudflare Browser Rendering

For Cloudflare Workers/Pages deployments, you can use [Cloudflare Browser Rendering](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/) for runtime screenshots.

### Installation

```bash
pnpm add @cloudflare/puppeteer
```

### Configuration

Configure the browser provider and binding name in your `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ogImage: {
    browser: {
      provider: 'cloudflare',
      binding: 'BROWSER' // your wrangler binding name
    }
  }
})
```

Configure the browser binding in `wrangler.toml`:

```toml [wrangler.toml]
name = "my-worker"
compatibility_date = "2025-09-15"
nodejs_compat = true

[browser]
binding = "BROWSER"
```

### How It Works

When using the cloudflare provider:
- **Development:** Uses local `chrome-launcher` (zero config)
- **Prerender/Build:** Uses `playwright`
- **Production Runtime:** Uses Cloudflare Browser Rendering

The module automatically handles session reuse and timeout handling for optimal performance within Cloudflare's rate limits.

### Limitations

- Free plan: 3 new browsers/minute
- Paid plan: 30 new browsers/minute
- 60-second idle timeout (handled automatically)

See [Cloudflare Browser Rendering limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/limits/) for details.
